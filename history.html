                In the United States, The THE RITZ-CARLTON
 Investing Company was established by Albert Keller who bought and franchised the name. In the early 1900s, several hotels were known as The THE RITZ-CARLTON
, in places such as Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlantic City and Boca Raton. However, by 1940 none of the hotels were operating except The THE RITZ-CARLTON
, Boston. The hotel embodies the finest luxury experience, Yankee ingenuity and Boston social sensibilities. The standards of service, dining and facilities of this Boston landmark served as a benchmark for all future THE RITZ-CARLTON
 hotels and resorts worldwide.
